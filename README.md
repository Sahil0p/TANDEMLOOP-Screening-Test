## 💡 Problem Details

### **🧮 Problem-1: Calculator**

- Performs Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division ➕➖✖️➗
- Handles division by zero ❌
- Class-based implementation 🏷️
- File: `Program-1.py`
- Output Examples:
   ```bash
    --- Simple Calculator ---
    1. Perform Calculation
    2. Exit
    Enter your choice: 1
    Enter first number: 10
    Enter second number: 20
    Enter operation (add / sub / mul / div): add
    Result: 30.0
   ```

### **🔢 Problem-2: Odd Number Series**

- Generates odd numbers up to a given number `a`
- File: `Program-2.py`
- Output example:
  ```
  Enter a number: 4
  Output: 1, 3, 5, 7
  ```
  

### **🔢 Problem-3: Odd Series with Even Adjustment**

- Generates odd numbers up to `a` if `a` is `odd`, or up to `a-1` if `a` is `even`
- File: `Program-3.py`
- Output example:
  ```
  Enter a number: 6
  Output: 1, 3, 5
  ```


### **📊 Problem-4: Count Multiples in a List**

- Accepts user input in flexible formats: commas, spaces, or continuous digits
- Counts multiples of numbers 1–9
- File: `Program-4.py`
- Output example:
  ```
  Enter numbers: 1,2,8,9,12,46,76,82,15,20,30
  Output: {1: 11, 2: 8, 3: 4, 4: 4, 5: 3, 6: 2, 7: 0, 8: 1, 9: 1}
  ```
