# Python Coding Test Solutions

## Overview
This repository contains solutions to the **Python coding test** consisting of 4 simple problems.  
The solutions are written in **Python 3.x** and are designed to be **user-friendly** and **menu-driven where applicable**.

---

## Instructions

1. **Repository Structure**
   - Each problem has its **own Python file**:
     - `Program-1.py` → Calculator  
     - `Program-2.py` → Odd Number Series  
     - `Program-3.py` → Odd Series with Even Adjustment  
     - `Program-4.py` → Count Multiples in a List  

2. **Programming Language**
   - All programs are written in **Python 3**.
   - Comments are included in the code for clarity.

3. **How to Run**
   - Make sure **Python 3.x** is installed on your system.
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the repository folder.
   - Run a program using:
   - ```bash
     python Program-1.py
     ```

## Input Guidelines

1. **Program-1 (Calculator)**
   - Enter two numbers and select operation (add, sub, mul, div).

2. **Program-2 / Program-3 (Odd Number Series)**
   - Enter a single integer a.
3. **Program-4 (Count Multiples)**
   - Input numbers in any style:
     - Comma-separated: 1,2,3,4
     - Space-separated: 1 2 3 4
4. **Output**
   - Each program prints results in a clear and formatted way,

## Problem Details

### **Problem-1: Calculator**

- Performs Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division
- Handles division by zero
- Class-based implementation
- File: `Program-1.py`
- Output Examples:
  - ```bash
    --- Simple Calculator ---
    1. Perform Calculation
    2. Exit
    Enter your choice: 1
    Enter first number: 10
    Enter second number: 20
    Enter operation (add / sub / mul / div): add
    Result: 30.0
  - ```

### **Problem-2: Odd Number Series**

- Generates odd numbers up to a given number a
- File: Program-2.py
> Output example:
  > `Enter a number: 4`
  > `Output: 1, 3, 5, 7`

### **Problem-3: Odd Series with Even Adjustment**

- Generates odd numbers up to a if a is odd, or up to a-1 if a is even
- File: `Program-3.py`
> Output example:
  > `Enter a number: 6`
  > `Output: 1, 3, 5`


### **Problem-4: Count Multiples in a List**

- Accepts user input in flexible formats: commas, spaces, or continuous digits
- Counts multiples of numbers 1–9
- File: Program-4.py
> Output example:
  > Enter numbers: 1,2,8,9,12,46,76,82,15,20,30
  > Output: {1: 11, 2: 8, 3: 4, 4: 4, 5: 3, 6: 2, 7: 0, 8: 1, 9: 1}

## Notes

- All programs demonstrate Python fundamentals:
  - Classes & objects
  - Loops & conditions
  - Lists & dictionaries
  - String manipulation & user input handling

- Programs are designed to be interactive, user-friendly, and robust.
